# Simplon Open Source (SOS)
## Presentation
The main purpose of this project is to collect all open-source projects from Simplon (from teachers, students and others).  
This might also be a good starting point to contribute to other projects. 

## Add your own project
To add your own project on SOS, just add it to src/projects.json and create a pull-request.  
See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.  
Everyone is welcome as long as you're eager to let others contribute.   
Be sure to have a complete readme.md on how to use your project.   
Having some issues registered might be a good start for some contributors, as well as an informative contributing.md and a licence. By default, we recommend the Apache License 2.0. 

To be considered for addition, a project needs to follow these requirements : 
* README.md : how to use this project,
* CONTRIBUTING.md : how to contribute to this project,
* LICENSE : to handle PI and legal matters,
* Open Issues : to guide new contributors.
